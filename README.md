# git-workshop
This repository is a collection of exercises in git that simulate real life problems.

## Usage
Pick an exercise. Enter the exercise directory.
Each exercise directory contains the following files:
1. env-setup.sh
2. README.md

The `README` file contains two things:
1. The scenario of the exercise - depics how you got to this situation and what is required of you to do (but of course it does not contains information about how to do so).
2. A set up section that explains how to run the `env-setup` file in order to create the git repos for the exercise.

# Welcome To Exersice 2

## The Scenario
You are working on some feature on a branch called `feature1`.
While you're working on your feature, two things happens:
1. The master branch advances.
2. One of you're teammates, start working on another feature on a branch called `feature2`.

You've successfully finished your feature, and your branch was merged to master.

After you've finished, your teammate also finised his feature and his branch was also merged to master.

Now after all your hard work, the project's client decides that he want your feature to be removed from the product i.e. to remove it from the master.

The problem is that you are not allowed to re-write the history of the master branch.

What do you do?

## Set-up
In order to create the environment, you need to open `git bash` shell from this directory and
run the following command:

`./env-setup.sh "<The path to a directory in which you want to have the exercise repository>"`

An exapmle of a real run:

`./env-setup.sh "C:\Users\Public\yoav\GitRepositories\GitLecture\Exercises\Exercise2"`

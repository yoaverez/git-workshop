# Welcome To Exersice 4

## The Scenario
You've given a bug to fix. You created a branch named `bugfix` for this task.

You work and make some commits.
You debug by loging strings i.e. you add log lines to the existing files.
You found the problem, fixed it and comitted the fix.

You forgot to delete all the logs you used for debugging and now your program log things that it should not log.

How can you fix this?

## Set-up
In order to create the environment, you need to open `git bash` shell from this directory and
run the following command:

`./env-setup.sh "<The path to a directory in which you want to have the exercise repository>"`

An exapmle of a real run:

`./env-setup.sh "C:\Users\Public\yoav\GitRepositories\GitLecture\Exercises\Exercise4"`
